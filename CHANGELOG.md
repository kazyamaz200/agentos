# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added built-in `analyst` and `reporter` agents for investigation workflows,
  structured reports, evidence provenance, and no-data reporting expectations.
- Added repository-scoped live GitHub evidence search for issues, pull
  requests, checks, and workflow run logs with provenance metadata and secret
  redaction.
- Added explicit Kubernetes log evidence search through configured kubectl,
  namespace, and label selector settings.
- Added recurring orchestration schedules with interval or cron timing,
  timezone-aware next-run calculation, pause/resume, run-now, execution
  history, and overlap prevention.
- Added built-in scheduled maintenance and reporting workflow templates for
  failed-run reports, repository health, security triage, dependency updates,
  release readiness, and stale memory/guideline checks.
- Added scheduled orchestration outcome notifications with inbox history,
  webhook delivery retries, and optional GitHub Issue or PR comments.
- Added built-in Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, and DevOps operations agents with
  planner routing, validation gates, and deployment-safety expectations.

### Fixed
- Fixed multi-arch Docker image builds by running the frontend build on the
  BuildKit build platform and cross-compiling the Go binary for each target
  architecture.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Expanded built-in agent registry for broader repository workflows, including
  frontend, security, release, dependency, QA, and convention-aware planning
  guidance.
- Repository-defined custom agent profiles through `.agentos/agents/*.yaml`.
- Reusable scenario templates, including repository-defined
  `.agentos/scenarios/*.yaml` templates.
- Repository-scoped continuous improvement memory with approval before reuse.
- Repository-specific guideline management and retrieval.
- Repository-scoped context search across memory, guidelines, orchestration
  runs, run artifacts, GitHub artifacts, and code/files.
- React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS Web UI with mobile-first
  orchestration, agent, audit, GitHub, memory, guideline, and search views.
- GitHub repository picker API for authenticated Web UI repository selection.

### Changed
- Orchestration routing now uses stronger built-in agent metadata, repository
  signals, scenario templates, and task recommendations when assigning
  specialist agents.
- The Web UI is served from built React assets instead of the legacy static
  HTML implementation.
- Frontend build, lint, and responsive smoke checks are part of CI and Docker
  image builds.

### Deferred
- Built-in Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes operations agents were moved to the
  v1.3.0 milestone.

### Notes
- GitHub-to-AgentOS webhook delivery is still not required for v1.2.0 unless a
  later release task changes that before tagging.
- The `on_pr_merge` close policy remains recorded for conservative follow-up;
  automatic PR merge detection remains deferred.

## [v1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- GitHub App installation token support for repository write operations.
- First-class Issue and Pull Request creation in orchestration records.
- RBAC checks and audit logs for automation actions.
- Centralized secret redaction for logs, reports, and generated artifacts.
- Explicit orchestration quality gates for expected outputs, tests, lint, and diffs.
- Live Web UI orchestration progress with logs, timeline events, and cancellation.
- Language and template controls for generated artifacts and GitHub output.
- Responsive Web UI improvements for mobile and narrow viewports.
- Issue-triggered orchestration through labels, slash-style commands, and manual import.
- Source issue status comments for issue-sourced orchestration runs.
- Issue close policies and human approval gates for conservative automation.
- Task-context recommendations for agent sets, templates, quality gates, and close policy defaults.

### Changed
- Web UI orchestration creation now exposes recommendations, GitHub output controls, quality gates, and approval state.
- GitHub automation defaults favor human approval for higher-risk or operations-oriented tasks.
- Orchestration completion records include GitHub metadata such as source issue, branch, pull request, close policy, approval status, and source close state.

### Notes
- GitHub-to-AgentOS webhook delivery is not required for v1.1 because deployments may not be reachable from GitHub.
- The `on_pr_merge` close policy is recorded for manual follow-up; webhook-based automatic PR merge detection is deferred.

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Empty remote repositories now complete multi-agent orchestration through deterministic fallback artifacts.
- `go-backend`, `docs`, and `ci-fixer` agents create expected fallback files when LLM execution returns no usable outputs.
- Timed-out contexts can still produce deterministic fallback artifacts.
- No-op orchestration success is prevented when expected outputs are missing.
